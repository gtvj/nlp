      "To search for correspondence relating to the Berlin Airlift in 1948, for example, your search in the online version of FO 409 could begin as follows: A search in series FO 409, the Foreign Office index, on The National Archives catalogue Step 2: Note the country code, file number and paper number from the index A typical index entry looks like this: Reading\u00a0the reference from right to left, the first number is the country code (see section 4.2 for advice on country codes with more than two digits), the second number is the file number and any other number will be a paper number, as shown above.", 
      "Step 3: Convert the Foreign Office references to National Archives references Use the advanced search in our catalogue to search using the country code prefixed by the word \u2018code\u2019, all in speech marks, and refine your search to FO (Foreign Office records) and the relevant year, like this: A search for \u201ccode 78\u201d in Foreign Office records from 1948 using the advanced search in The National Archives catalogue The dropdown list on catalogue search results pages that alllows you to sort results by reference Step 4: Identify the relevant National Archives reference Use the dropdown list to sort your search results by reference \u2013 this will present results in file and paper number order, allowing you to easily find the FO reference covering the paper and file number from your index entry.",

      "Other reasons to use the registers are: You may find a fuller description You may find a different description You may find references to letters (regarding people, events and so on) which do not survive Search for correspondence from this period in\u00a0any of the following ways: 5.1 Using just our catalogue Use the advanced search page in our catalogue, search by keyword (including people, places and subject matters) and restrict your search to references HO 45 and HO 144.", 
      "The registry system changed many times over the years and there are therefore distinct sets of registers within HO 46 for different years, as shown below: 1839-1849 \u2013 HO 46/1A, HO 46/1B and HO 46/1C (these are for letters registered retrospectively once the system of registration began \u2013 they are known as OS {Old Series} papers) 1850-1871 (up to March 8) \u2013 HO 46/2-47 1871-1880 \u2013 HO 46/48-70 (all incoming papers in this period were registered in a series running from 1 to 100,000) 1881-1901 \u2013 HO 46/71-133 (in 1880 a new system of consecutive numbers started, with an A prefix; this was followed shortly afterwards by a series with B, V and X prefixes) 1902-1948 \u2013 HO 46/134-389 (the system of registration in these years was based on a six figure series starting at 100,001) 5.3 Using the catalogue, the registers and the packing list Often the only way to find correspondence\u00a0via the registers\u00a0is to consult the\u00a0packing lists."

      "Other reasons for unsuccessful searches may include: the estate was not liable to death duty the assets were valued at less than \u00a31,500 (in these cases taxes were often not collected and the register entry was often not filled in with all the details) alternative spellings of personal names and place names were used (English spelling had not yet been standardised in this period) Contact us for advice Still need help?"

      "Payments made to the Crown recorded in the pipe rolls include: debts owed offerings for the king\u2019s favour land rents financial penalties imposed by the king\u2019s justices in eyre courts or assize courts feudal taxes money from vacant Church land Crown expenditure recorded in the pipe rolls includes: grants of alms and statutory payments to individuals money spent on royal manors and houses wages for royal servants and royal gifts 3.",
